From July 26, 2023, this commonly used English-language assessment will introduce multiple new features tailored for test takers and educational institutions. In this blog, we'll explore these changes comprehensively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ntf\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New TOEFL Format Coming in July 2023</strong></h3>\n<p>We're thrilled to share some exciting news with you! The updated TOEFL format has been designed to make the test more manageable. Over recent years, there has been a decrease in the annual total of TOEFL tests taken, attributed to the perceived difficulty of the test. To assist test-takers, ETS has introduced new changes to the TOEFL, shortening the test duration and allowing more time for answering questions. The following excerpt, directly from ETS TOEFL, specifies the exact alterations made.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Changes to the Reading, Listening, &amp; Writing Sections</strong></h3>\n<p>To assist in reaching your desired score, revisions to the TOEFL will be introduced in July 2023. These changes encompass updates in the reading, listening, and writing sections. To conveniently understand the alterations made, let's examine a comparative table displaying the modifications in each section of the new TOEFL.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Old TOEFL format vs New TOEFL format</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 113.248%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.5462%;\"><strong>Section</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.6218%;\"><strong>Old TOEFL Format</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.8042%;\"><strong>New TOEFL Format</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.5462%;\">Reading</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.6218%;\">\n<p>3 to 4 reading passages <br>10 questions each  <br>54 to 72 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>72/(10*4) = 1.8 minutes per question</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.8042%;\">\n<p>2 reading passages <br>10 questions each <br>36 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>1.8 minutes per question</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Question Types will remain same</strong></em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.5462%;\">Listening</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.6218%;\">\n<p>3 to 4 lectures, 6 questions each <br>2 to 3 conversations, 5 questions each<br>Random unscored questions<br>41 to 57 minutes + unscored questions</p>\n<p><strong>0.8 min per question - unscored questions</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.8042%;\">\n<p>3 lectures, each 3–5 minutes; 6 questions each<br>2 convos, each 3 minutes; 5 questions each<br><em><strong>No more unscored questions<br></strong></em>36 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>15-18 minutes to complete questions</strong><br><strong>0.54-0.64 mins per question</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Question Types will remain same</strong></em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.5462%;\">Writing</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.6218%;\">\n<p><strong>2 writing tasks, 50 minutes</strong></p>\n<p>- Writing Integrated Task 1, 20 minutes</p>\n<p>- Writing Independent Task 2, 30 minutes</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.8042%;\">\n<p><strong>2 writing Tasks, 30 minutes</strong></p>\n<p>- Integrated Task 1, 20 minutes</p>\n<p>- Academic Discussion Task 2, 10 minutes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Prepare For The New TOEFL</strong></h3>\n<p>The most frequently asked question we've received is: \"What should I do to get ready for the new TOEFL changes?\" The straightforward response is: NOT MUCH! Yes, you read that right. There's not a substantial amount you need to alter in your preparation for these new TOEFL changes. The majority of question types remain the same. These changes actually simplify the TOEFL. You can continue using your existing TOEFL preparation materials for practicing, except for the addition of the new writing academic discussion question type. Nonetheless, this new writing question is notably simpler compared to the former independent writing question, so our emphasis will be on familiarizing you with this particular TOEFL writing modification.</p>",
